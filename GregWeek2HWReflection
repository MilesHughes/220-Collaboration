I spent a solid 10 minutes finding colors and configuring shapes to make a nice looking breakfast of sausage and eggs. Then I asked ChatGPT to make food and it completed the job nearly flawlessly in about 4 seconds (the pizza looks pretty good but having no toppings in the center is insane). It's a little depressing just how much better AI is becoming at nearly everything nowadays compared to humans. I hope that AI will remain as a tool for humans to use rather than a crutch for humans to become dependent on.

I made a very basic player controller and a dvd logo style "obstacle" that doesn't have any collision yet. It is once again depressing how fast chatGPT made something faster and better than me. Obviously this is a very basic coding exercise, and currently AI is not capable of writing more complex code better than a human. However, I expect AI to reach the point of being able to replicate complicated code much faster than it takes me to reach that point. I'm not too worried about it, but if they ever make an AI model capable of making creative choices I'm cooked.
